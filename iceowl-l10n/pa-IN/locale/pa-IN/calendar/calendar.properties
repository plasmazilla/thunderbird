#   (Particularly needed to guess the most relevant timezones if there are

#    earlier ZoneInfo timezone names.  Sample explanations for English below.)

# Guessed Timezone errors and warnings.
# Testing note:
# * remove preference for calendar.timezone.default in userprofile/prefs.js
# * repeat
#   - set OS timezone to a city (windows: click right on clock in taskbar)
#   - restart: sunbird -jsconsole
#   - observe guess in error console and verify whether guessed timezone city
#     makes sense for OS city.
#
# 'Warning: Operating system timezone "E. South America Standard Time"
#  no longer matches ZoneInfo timezone "America/Sao_Paulo".'
# Testing notes:
# - Brasil DST change dates are set every year by decree, so likely out of sync.
# - Only appears on OSes from which timezone can be obtained
#   (windows; or TZ env var, /etc/localtime target path, or line in
#    /etc/timezone or /etc/sysconfig/clock contains ZoneInfo timezone id).
# - Windows: turning off "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving time"
#   can also trigger this warning.
WarningOSTZNoMatch=Warning: Operating system timezone "%1$S"\nno longer matches the internal ZoneInfo timezone "%2$S".

# "Skipping Operating System timezone 'Pacific/New_Country'."
# Testing note: not easily testable.  May occur someday if (non-windows)
# OS uses different version of ZoneInfo database which has a timezone name
# that is not included in our current ZoneInfo database (or if the mapping
# mapping from windows to ZoneInfo timezone ids does).
SkippingOSTimezone=Skipping Operating System timezone '%1$S'.

# "Skipping locale timezone 'America/New_Yawk'."
# Testing note: Skipping occurs if a likelyTimezone id is unknown or misspelled.
SkippingLocaleTimezone=Skipping locale timezone '%1$S'.

# Testing note: "No match" timezones include Bucharest on W2k.
# Brazil timezones may be "No match" (change every year, so often out of date,
# and changes are often more than a week different).
warningUsingFloatingTZNoMatch=Warning: Using "floating" timezone.\nNo ZoneInfo timezone data matched the operating system timezone data.

# "Warning:  Using guessed timezone
#    America/New York (UTC-0500/-0400).
#    [rfc2445 summer daylight saving shift rules for timezone]

TZAlmostMatchesOSDifferAtMostAWeek=This ZoneInfo timezone almost matches the operating system timezone.\nFor this rule, the next transitions between daylight and standard time\ndiffer at most a week from the operating system timezone transitions.\nThere may be discrepancies in the data, such as differing start date,\nor differing rule, or approximation for non-Gregorian-calendar rule.

TZSeemsToMatchOS=This ZoneInfo timezone seems to match the operating system timezone this year.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (TZFromOS):
# used for a display of a chosen timezone

TZFromOS=This ZoneInfo timezone was chosen based on the operating system timezone\nidentifier "%1$S".

# Localization note (TZFromLocale): Substitute name of your locale language.
TZFromLocale=This ZoneInfo timezone was chosen based on matching the operating system\ntimezone with likely timezones for internet users using US English.

TZFromKnownTimezones=This ZoneInfo timezone was chosen based on matching the operating system\ntimezone with known timezones in alphabetical order of timezone id.
