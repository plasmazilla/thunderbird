icedove (33.0~b1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Mozilla implemented TLS 1.2 in NSS version 3.15.1 and Thunderbird 31.0 uses
  this as the default. It won't fall back to older protocol versions.

  This means every connection from Thunderbird/Icedove to a mail server will
  using TLS 1.2 with no fall back if you have configured TLS/SSL or STARTTLS for
  your connections.

  Some users reported trouble by this behavior. In case you are unable to get
  or sent any mails anymore from or to your mail server please ensure that
  your email provider is fully supporting TLS 1.2 if possible.

  There were reports that this causes problems with some providers (Bug
  #761245). This is usually indicated by:

   "connection to SMTP server was lost in the middle of the transaction."

  For information on how to fix that check README.Debian.

icedove (3.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The old profile folder ~/.mozilla-thunderbird will renamed into ~/.icedove on
  the first startup of icedove 3.0. So if you in trouble with it, make a
  backup before starting icedove 3.0.
