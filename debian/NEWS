icedove (31.3.0-1~deb7u1) stable-security; urgency=low

  Due to the  BEAST vulnerability Icedove does not support SSLv3 encrypted
  connections by default any longer.

  However you can still reactivate SSLv3 as described in README.Debian.

icedove (31.2.0-1~deb7u1) stable-security; urgency=low

  Mozilla implemented TLS 1.2 in NSS version 3.15.1 and Thunderbird 31.0 uses
  this as the default. Thunderbird/Icedove is fall back to older TLS versions
  if the server is requesting this.

  This means every connection from Thunderbird/Icedove to a mail server will
  start using TLS 1.2 and want fall back through 1.1 and 1.0 to SSLv3 if you
  have configured TLS/SSL or STARTTLS for your connections.

  Some users reported trouble by this behavior. In case you are unable to get
  or sent any mails anymore from or to your mail server please ensure that
  your email provider is fully supporting TLS 1.2 if possible.

  There were reports that this causes problems with some providers (Bug
  #761245). This is usually indicated by:

   "connection to SMTP server was lost in the middle of the transaction."

  For information on how to fix that check README.Debian.

icedove (24.5.0-1~deb7u1) stable-security; urgency=low

  Due to a symbol versioning problem (#745593) Mozilla Ligthning isn't
  compatible with Icedove 24. Please use the Debian package
  iceowl-extension instead. To do so run icedove in safe-mode (icedove
  -safe-mode), uninstall lightning and afterwards install iceowl-extension
  via apt.

  A fix to make Lightning and Icedove compatible again is in the works.

icedove (3.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The old profile folder ~/.mozilla-thunderbird will renamed into ~/.icedove on
  the first startup of icedove 3.0. So if you in trouble with it, make a
  backup before starting icedove 3.0.
