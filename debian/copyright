Disclaimer: The original upstream tarball is modified from upstream by
 removing a set of sourceless binary, non-free, and VCS-related files. You
 can find a repack.py script in the debian directory doing this cleanup,
 using filtering data present in a source.filter file in the same directory.
 If this file is incomplete, which I'm pretty sure is the case, because it's
 difficult not to forget anything in this huge amount of data, please file
 a bug or contact me.
 Some licensing terms are not included verbatim in this file on purpose, for
 terms that are available in a file in subdirectories that are not used to
 build the binary packages.

 .
 1. Definitions.
 .
    1.1. "Contributor" means each entity that creates or contributes to
         the creation of Modifications.
 .
    1.2. "Contributor Version" means the combination of the Original
         Code, prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the
         Modifications made by that particular Contributor.
 .
    1.3. "Covered Code" means the Original Code or Modifications or the
         combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each
         case including portions thereof.
 .
    1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism
         generally accepted in the software development community for
         the electronic transfer of data.
 .
    1.5. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source
         Code.
 .
    1.6. "Initial Developer" means the individual or entity identified
         as the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by
         Exhibit A.

 .
    1.9. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the
         substance or structure of either the Original Code or any
         previous Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a

 .
    1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code
          which is described in the Source Code notice required by
          Exhibit A as Original Code, and which, at the time of its
          release under this License is not already Covered Code
          governed by this License.
 .
    1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
          making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,

          list of source code differential comparisons against either
          the Original Code or another well known, available Covered
          Code of the Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a
          compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate
          decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for
          no charge.
 .
    1.12. "You" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights

      (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
          Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell
          ("Utilize") the Original Code (or portions thereof), but
          solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably
          necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or
          portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be
          necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
    3.1. Application of License.
    The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
    Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
    of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
    distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
    Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of
    this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
    include an additional document offering the additional rights
    described in Section 3.5.
 .
    3.2. Availability of Source Code.
    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
    made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
    either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
    Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
    Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve
    (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
    least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
    Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
    responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
    available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
    maintained by a third party.
 .
    3.3. Description of Modifications.
    You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain
    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code
    and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
    that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
    Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
    name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in
    any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
    which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
      (a) Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual
          property right in particular functionality or code (or its
          utilization under this License), you must include a text file
          with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
          describes the claim and the party making the claim in
          sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
          If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification
          available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
          modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
          thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
          appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
          to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
          knowledge has been obtained.
      (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your Modification is an application programming interface
          and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary
          to implement that API, you must also include this information
          in the LEGAL file.
 .
    3.5. Required Notices.
    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
    Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source
    Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered
    Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your
    name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it
    is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
    due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a
    location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be
    likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to
    charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
    may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
    any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
    offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
    Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
    Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
    and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
    the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
    including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
    obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
    included in any notice in an Executable version, related
    documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
    rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
    Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice,
    which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
    You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
    license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or
    alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
    rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
    version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
    that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
    alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby
    agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for
    any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
    as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
    3.7. Larger Works.
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
    the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
    Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
    statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
    this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
    limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
    included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
    included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
    be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
    able to understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
    attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
    6.1. New Versions.
    Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
    and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
    6.2. Effect of New Versions.
    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
 .
    6.3. Derivative Works.
    If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you
    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
    Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your
    license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL",
    "Netscape", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear
    anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your
    version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla
    Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of
    the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
    described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
    modifications of this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
    FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
    THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
    All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
    shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
    License shall survive.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
    CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR
    ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION
    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
    The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
    48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
    software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
    terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
    C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June
    1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
    those rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
    California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
    any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
    With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
    of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the
    United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing,
    all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute
    relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final
    and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of
    arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be
    held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of
    JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement
    shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
    Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
    County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
    including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
    fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention
    on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
    excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
    a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply
    to this License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
    Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
    Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
    indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License,
    based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available,
    the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other
    relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to
    distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

 .
     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.
 .
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
          (c) Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.
 .
     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.
 .
     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.
 .
     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.
 .
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.
 .
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.
 .
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

          IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.
          Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape
          has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's Branded Code.
          To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making
          such third party code available under this License, Netscape may
          choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being
          required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if
          such code would otherwise be considered "Modifications" under

               Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than the
               Netscape's Branded Code which are released by Netscape
               during the two (2) years following the release date of the
               Original Code, without such additional products becoming
               subject to the terms of this License, and may license such
               additional products on different terms from those contained
               in this License.
 .
               V.3. Alternative Licensing.
               Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded

               such Netscape Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of
               this License, and may license such Netscape Branded Code on
               different terms from those contained in this License.
 .
          VI. Litigation.
          Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the

   terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
   of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
   they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
   restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
   If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
   a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable

   with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
   Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
   You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
   Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their
   option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either
   this License or such Secondary License(s).

   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
   Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
   of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
   support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
   hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by
   such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
   terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and
   limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
   5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
   You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
   then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
   reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly
   and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
   Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
   means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover,
   Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis
   if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
   means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with
   this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days
   after Your receipt of the notice.
 .
   5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
   and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
   infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
   Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
   terminate.
 .
   5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
   user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
   been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
   termination shall survive termination.
 .
 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
   as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
   any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.
 .
 7. Limitation of Liability
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
 .
 8. Litigation
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
 .
 9. Miscellaneous
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.
 .
 10. Versions of the License
 10.1. New Versions
   Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
   10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
   publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
   distinguishing version number.
 .
 10.2. Effect of New Versions
   You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
   License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under
   the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
 .
 10.3. Modified Versions
   If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
   new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
   this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name
   of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs
   from this License).
 .
 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
   If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
   Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
   described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
